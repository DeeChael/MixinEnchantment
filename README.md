# The Others - Enchantment
## Very powerful enchantment extension plugin for minecraft

### For Developer
Because this project can't be used now, so there is no api for you guys.\
But don't worry, we will add api when this plugin is available!

This plugin uses Mixin features, implemented by https://github.com/Apisium/PaperShelled

### For server owner
Because this plugin is used for TheOthers, so we don't provide any built jar.\
If you want to use this plugin, just build it by yourself.

To use:\
This plugin uses Mixin, so you cannot just use this in a normal spigot server core.\
The lowest requirement is minecraft version over 1.18.2 and must be a paper server core or its branch, and download the PaperShelled.jar right here: https://github.com/Apisium/PaperShelled/actions \
About how to use PaperShelled, you can see in the README on the project page of PaperShelled.
